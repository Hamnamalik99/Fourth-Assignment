# Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of those numbers.

# List of numbers to be summed
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Main function where the sum is calculated and printed
def main():
    # Calculate and print the sum of the numbers
    print(sum(numbers))

# This block ensures that the main function runs only if the script is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
